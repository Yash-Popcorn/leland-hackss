## About

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This project was written for the [LeLand Hacks Hackathon](https://lelandhacks.com/). Here is the team that created this project:

- Frontend Engineer (**[@Yash-Popcorn](https://github.com/Yash-Popcorn)**)
- Backend Engineer (**[@Yash-Singh1](https://github.com/Yash-Singh1)**)
- Presentation (**[@EpicCodeWizard](https://github.com/EpicCodeWizard)**)

## Getting Started

Before, doing anything, you need to [get the Google Maps key](https://developers.google.com/maps/get-started#quickstart).

Next, paste the API key you got by following the steps into the `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` part in the `.env` file.

Now, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
